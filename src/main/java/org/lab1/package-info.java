/**
 * Contains a generic implementation of a singly linked list, `LinkedList`, designed to store elements of the same type.
 * This class is authored by Pevtsova Angelina from the 61 group.
 *
 * <p>It provides functionalities to add, delete, retrieve, and search for elements within the list, as well as utility methods to check for emptiness,
 * retrieve the index of elements, and obtain the size of the list.</p>
 *
 * <p>The package also includes a `Node` class, used internally by the `LinkedList` class to represent each element of the list.</p>
