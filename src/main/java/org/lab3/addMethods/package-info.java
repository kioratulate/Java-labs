/**
 *Contains classes for measuring the performance of various methods for adding elements to collections and lists.
 *
 * <p>The package includes implementations for adding elements to collections (`AddToCollection`) and lists (`AddToList`).
 * Additionally, it provides classes for specific scenarios, such as adding an element to the last position of a list (`AddLastToList`),
 * adding an element to the first position of a list (`AddFirstToList`), adding an element to the middle of a list (`AddMiddleToList`),
 * adding an element at a random position in a list (`AddRandToList`), and adding all elements from one collection to another collection (`AddAllToCollection`).</p>
 *
 * <p>These classes offer flexibility for benchmarking and comparing the performance of different approaches to adding elements in Java.</p>
